# Hepatitis-C-Classification

Hepatitis-C-Classification is a .ipynb for Hepatitis-C Classification. I have done a basic classification with logistic regression. There are other ways to explore. This is just a fun project. 

## Necessary modules

Make sure you have ```scikit-learn``` and  ```pandas``` installed. I used google collaboratory. If you also use that then you won't need to install anything on your machine.



## Dataset
Search internet for UCI- Hepatitis dataset.
